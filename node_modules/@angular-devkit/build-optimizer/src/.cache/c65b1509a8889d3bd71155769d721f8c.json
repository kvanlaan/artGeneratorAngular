tag: these are the format produced by GRPC in\n * return values. These may contain default-value mappings for all tags in the\n * oneof but the type tag specifies which one was actually set.\n *\n * 2) Messages that don't contain a type tag: these are the format required by\n * GRPC as inputs. If we emitted objects with type tags, ProtoBuf.js would\n * choke claiming that the tags aren't fields in the Message.\n *\n * Allowing both formats here makes the serializer able to consume the outputs\n * it produces: for all messages it supports, fromX(toX(value)) == value.\n *\n * Note that case 2 suffers from ambiguity: if multiple tags are present\n * without a type tag then the callers are structured in such a way that the\n * first invocation will win. Since we only parse in this mode when parsing\n * the output of a serialize method this works, but it's not a general\n * solution.\n *\n * Unfortunately there is no general solution here because proto3 makes it\n * impossible to distinguish unset from explicitly set fields: both have the\n * default value for the type. Without the type tag but multiple value tags\n * it's possible to have default values for each tag in the oneof and not be\n * able to know which was actually in effect.\n */\nfunction hasTag(obj, type, tag) {\n    return type === tag || (!type && tag in obj);\n}\n/**\n * Detect React Native.\n *\n * @return {boolean} True if ReactNative environment is detected.\n */\nvar isReactNative = function () {\n    return (typeof navigator === 'object' && navigator['product'] === 'ReactNative');\n};\nvar ERROR_NAME = 'FirebaseError';\nvar captureStackTrace = Error\n    .captureStackTrace;\nvar FirebaseError = /** @class */ /*@__PURE__*/ (function () {\n    function FirebaseError(code, message) {\n        this.code = code;\n        this.message = message;\n        // We want the stack value, if implemented by Error\n        if (captureStackTrace) {\n            // Patches this.stack, omitted calls above ErrorFactory#create\n            captureStackTrace(this, ErrorFactory.prototype.create);\n        }\n        else {\n            try {\n                // In case of IE11, stack will be set only after error is raised.\n                // https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/scripting/javascript/reference/stack-property-error-javascript\n                throw Error.apply(this, arguments);\n            }\n            catch (err) {\n                this.name = ERROR_NAME;\n                // Make non-enumerable getter for the property.\n                Object.defineProperty(this, 'stack', {\n                    get: function () {\n                        return err.stack;\n                    }\n                });\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return FirebaseError;\n}());\n// Back-door inheritance\nFirebaseError.prototype = Object.create(Error.prototype);\nFirebaseError.prototype.constructor = FirebaseError;\nFirebaseError.prototype.name = ERROR_NAME;\nvar ErrorFactory = /** @class */ /*@__PURE__*/ (function () {\n    function ErrorFactory(service, serviceName, errors) {\n        this.service = service;\n        this.serviceName = serviceName;\n        this.errors = errors;\n        // Matches {$name}, by default.\n        this.pattern = /\\{\\$([^}]+)}/g;\n        // empty\n    }\n    ErrorFactory.prototype.create = function (code, data) {\n        if (data === undefined) {\n            data = {};\n        }\n        var template = this.errors[code];\n        var fullCode = this.service + '/' + code;\n        var message;\n        if (template === undefined) {\n            message = 'Error';\n        }\n        else {\n            message = template.replace(this.pattern, function (match, key) {\n                var value = data[key];\n                return value !== undefined ? value.toString() : '<' + key + '?>';\n            });\n        }\n        // Service: Error message (service/code).\n        message = this.serviceName + ': ' + message + ' (' + fullCode + ').';\n        var err = new FirebaseError(fullCode, message);\n        // Populate the Error object with message parts for programmatic\n        // accesses (e.g., e.file).\n        for (var prop in data) {\n            if (!data.hasOwnProperty(prop) || prop.slice(-1) === '_') {\n                continue;\n            }\n            err[prop] = data[prop];\n        }\n        return err;\n    };\n    return ErrorFactory;\n}());\n/**\n * Copyright 2017 Google Inc.\n *\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n *\n *   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n *\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n * limitations under the License.\n */\n// Copyright 2011 The Closure Library Authors.

This owner lease is then verified inside every\n * transaction to ensure the lease has not been lost.\n *\n * If a tab opts not to acquire the owner lease (because there's an existing\n * non-expired owner) or loses the owner lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a\n * failed state and all subsequent operations will automatically fail.\n *\n * The current owner regularly refreshes the owner lease with new timestamps to\n * prevent newly-opened tabs from taking over ownership.\n *\n * Additionally there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the owner\n * lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make sure that\n * a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the owner lease).\n * Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload since it is\n * an asynchronous API.
